FVWM-KISe (ver. 3.0.1)

Rather than a single lengthy config, Fvwm-KISe employs the myExt model, which consists of individual small scripts (configs). These scripts are organized into folders and executed in the same sequence as the original Fvwm.

.fvwm/core  + config  -- core scripts folder and the default config file.

.fvwm/core/
	1Functions
	2Styles
	3Colorsets
	4Menus
	5Bindings
	6Decor
	7Modules

To add and make changes to the core and create your own without being overwritten by new updates, it includes one additional user folder and system file:

.fvwm/user + userExt.sys -- user scripts folder and a file for reading the core and user scripts.

This structure aids in maintaining, debugging, and developing new functions, decor, and modules.

To manage wallpapers, including installation and configuration, there are two folders:

.fvwm/images
.fvwm/setup

Each script includes a readme.txt file that describes how to install it and where to add it in the .fvwm/userExt.sys file. Additionally, major changes are made in userExt.sys, such as adjusting the geometry (size and position on the screen) and introducing new options (color or behavior).

To make major changes like adding more icons to the icon panel, copy the entire folder to .fvwm/user. For example, .fvwm/core/7Modules/SimpleButton, and modify the read line in userExt.sys.

"Read $[CORE_DIR]/7Modules/SimpleButton/init.conf" to
"Read $[USER_DIR]/SimpleButton/init.conf"
(with variable $[USER_DIR])

Note: Three folders are automatically copied to .fvwm/user at first load.

AutoMoveWin
SimpleButton
WorkButtons

To modify them, click any of them in the menu (left-click) <System>.
