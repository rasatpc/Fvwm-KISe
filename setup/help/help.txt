FVWM-KISe (ver. 1.9.0)

The default FVWM config is the base. Instead of one lengthy config, Fvwm-KISe is using the myExt model of individual small scripts. They are organized into folders and run in the same sequence as the original Fvwm.

.fvwm/core  + config  -- core scripts (configs) folder and the default configuration file.

.fvwm/core/
	1Functions
	2Styles
	3Colorsets
	4Menus
	5Bindings
	6Decor
	7Modules

To add and make changes in the core and to create your own without being overwritten by new updates, it includes one additional user folder and system file:

.fvwm/user  + userExt.sys  -- user scripts folder and one file that reads the core and user scripts.

This structure helps to maintain, debug, and create new functions, decor, and modules.

To manage wallpapers, how to install and configure, it includes two folders:

.fvwm/images
.fvwm/setup

Each script has readme.txt with a description of how to install and where to add in .fvwm/userExt.sys. Also in userExt.sys, major changes are made such as geometry (size and location on screen), and new options (color or behavior).

For major modifications such as adding more icons to the icon panel, copy the whole folder to .fvwm/user. For example, .fvwm/core/7Modules/SimpleButton and change the read line in userExt.sys

"Read $[CORE_DIR]/7Modules/SimpleButton/simpleB.sys" to
"Read $[USER_DIR]/SimpleButton/simpleB.sys"
(with variable $[USER_DIR])

Note: At first load, three folders are automatically copied to .fvwm/user.
AutoMoveWin
SimpleButton
WorkButtons
To modify them, in the menu (left-click) <System>, click any of them.

Any inspiring and functional script, please share on:
