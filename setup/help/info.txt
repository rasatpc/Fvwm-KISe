WELCOME to F(?) Virtual Window Manager (FVWM).

If you are new to FVWM, the first thing to bear in mind it is not a Desktop Environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc). DE comes with a collection of preconfigured settings and software (file managers, docks/panels, and so on) all integrated together. 

FVWM is a Window Manager (WM). What sets it apart from other WMs, it is also a *Virtual* window manager. Among the powerful Fvwm features is the virtual desktop, which allows you to place windows on an area much larger than the actual size of the visible display.

FVWM3 (ver. 1.0.9)

It comes with a minimal startup configuration. It gives the user the choice of expression. Details such as the appearance of windows, the function of panels, pagers, programs that will be used, and mouse/key control are created and defined by the user.

FVWM-KISe (ver. 1.9.1)

Fvwm-Keep-It-Simple & elegant is a simplified version of myExt which started as a collection of ready-made scripts (configs). A simple and elegant base and feature-rich rich, for you to use, modify or add your own.

The default FVWM config file is the base. In KISe it is split into folders and runs in the same sequence as the original. The additional scripts are added in associated folders. This structure helps to maintain, debug, and create new functions, decor, and modules.

A picture is worth of thousand words. The attached illustrated screenshot shows the main features of Fvwm-KISe.
