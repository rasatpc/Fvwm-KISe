WELCOME to F(?) Virtual Window Manager (FVWM).

If you are new to FVWM, the first thing to bear in mind is that it is not a Desktop Environment (like GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.). A DE comes with a collection of preconfigured settings and software (such as file managers, docks/panels, and so on), all integrated together. 

FVWM is a Window Manager (WM). What sets it apart from other WMs is that it is also a *Virtual* window manager. Among the powerful Fvwm features is the virtual desktop, which allows you to place windows on an area much larger than the visible display itself.

FVWM3 (ver. 1.1.2)

It includes a minimal startup configuration, allowing users to express their preferences. Details such as window appearance, panel functions, pager usage, selected programs, and mouse/key controls are determined by the user.

FVWM-KISe (ver. 3.0.1)

Fvwm-Keep-It-Simple & elegant is a streamlined version of myExt that began as a collection of pre-made scripts (configs). It offers a simple yet elegant base that is feature-rich, allowing you to use, modify, or add your custom elements.

The default FVWM config file serves as the base. In KISe, it is organized into folders and operates in the same sequence as the original. Additional scripts are included in their respective folders. This structure facilitates maintenance, debugging, and the creation of new functions, decor, and modules.

A picture is worth a thousand words. The attached illustrated screenshot shows the key features of Fvwm-KISe.
