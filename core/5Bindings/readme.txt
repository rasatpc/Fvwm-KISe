Bindings are actions/functions that can be triggered by hitting a key (or key combination) or mouse buttons. These bindings can be used to launch programs, run buit in functions (like Maximize or Iconify), or even run custom functions. This how to configure FVWM to react to key presses and mouse clicks.
