Here you can add your own scripts without getting affected by version updates or other official changes.

For example, copy one of the scripts from .fvwm/core or make your own, and add the Read link in .fvwm/userExt.sys.

Replace $[CORE_DIR] with $[USER_DIR], example:
Read $[CORE_DIR]/4Menus/KMenu/kMenu.conf
to
Read $[USER_DIR]/KMenu/kMenu.conf
