# Fvwm-KISe
Fvwm Keep-It-Simple & elegant - is a simplified version of Fvwm-myExt collection of ready-made scripts (configs). KISe is a simple and elegant base to use, modify, or add your own.

The default Fvwm config file is the base. In KISe it is split into associated folders and runs in the same sequence as the original. This structure helps to maintain, debug, and create new functions, decor, and modules. Currently, there are 25 scripts of functions, styles, menus, decor, and modules.
