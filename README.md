# Fvwm-KISe
Fvwm-Keep-It-Simple &amp; elegant is a simplified version of myEXT extensions. A simple and elegant base for you to use, modify or add your own.

The default FVWM config file is the base. In KISe it is split into folders and runs in the same sequence as the original. The additional scripts are added in associated folders. This structure helps to maintain, debug, and create new functions, decor, and modules.

Everything is placed in ~/.fvwm. The compressed zip file contains four folders: core, images, setup, and user, and the system file (config). When Fvwm is loaded for the first time, the config creates one sub-system file (userExt.sys) which reads the scripts and runs the system.
