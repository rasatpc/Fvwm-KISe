# Fvwm-KISe
Fvwm Keep-It-Simple & Elegant is a streamlined version of the Fvwm-myExt collection of ready-made scripts (configs). KISe serves as a simple and elegant base for using, modifying, or adding your own scripts.

The default Fvwm config file serves as the basep. In KISe, it is organized into associated folders and operates in the same sequence as the original. This structure aids in maintaining, debugging, and creating new functions, decor, and modules. There are 25 scripts (configs) encompassing functions, styles, menus, d√©cor, and modules.
